## Notes
The Notes application is a simple React app that helps a typical user to keep an eye on his/her buisness
and resembles what exactly the user has to do.

**Welcome to the Notes project! :bowtie:**

The app idea is simple:
+ an easy way to get access to your notes
+ the ability to have your buisness plan in the app

Speaking about the app, there is only one page and it consists of a header and a main component.
This page represents the functionality of the project.

## *Main page: :smile:
   1. The user can add new notes optionally but the note field mustn't be an empty string
   2. Each note can be deleted anytime
   3. There is an opportunity to edit each note from the notes list
   4. The use can filter all the notes by the tags if they are provided in the note by "#"
